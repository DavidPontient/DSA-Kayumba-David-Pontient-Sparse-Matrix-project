DSA HW01 - Sparse Matrix
This project performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two sparse matrices using Python. It reads matrix data from matrix1.txt and matrix3.txt, processes only the non-zero values to save space, and outputs the result both to the terminal and a file called result.txt. The program automatically loads the matrix files and lets the user choose the operation to perform. While I watched some ALX tutorial videos and discussed ideas with friends to understand the concept better, I wrote and tested the final code on my own, ensuring it meets all requirements for functionality, clarity, and documentation.
#how to run
Make sure your folder has the following files:
matrix1.txt
matrix3.txt
main.py
SparseM.py
Run the program:
python main.py
